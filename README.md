# Changes
## Overall

* Resized and/or recompressed all images that needed that.

## index.html

* By adding the 'defer' keyword, I deferred the loading and execution
of `analytics.js`, until after the initial render or other critical parts of the
page have finished loading.
* By adding `media = "print"`
